## How does SolHunt differ from competitors?
**Quizlet, Chegg, and CourseHero**:  
These three web applications offer solutions through a subscription and with an account registered. To be more precise, once an account is created Quizlet offers 2 free solutions, CourseHero offers 5 free solutions, and Chegg offers one sample solution. SolHunt differs from them by offering **FREE** solutions to textbook questions, and there is also no need to be registered in to view explanations nor to answer questions.  

**Homeworklib**:  
Homeworklib does not require subscription and also does not require registration for users to visualize solutions. However, not every user is allowed to give an answer to a textbook problem. In addition, a solution for a unanswered question can be requested, but at least 10 different requests are required, and each request costs virtual coins, which can be bought or earned via interaction. SolHunt will differ from Homeworlib by allowing any user to provide an answer to a question, which then can be upvoted by other users. We will also allow users to upload video explanations to problems which is something that Homeworklib does not have.

## Our target users:
SolHunt has two main target users, which are: Students that are looking for answers without any constraints, such as subscriptions or account registration, and people who enjoy answering problems and want to help other students by providing explanations to textbook problems. Our competitors did not focus on those users because their main focus is on revenue and having only verified experts answering questions. They seek revenues via the subscriptions and they limit solutions to experts  by requiring an application to become an expert to answer solutions. It is difficult for our competitors to reach our first target users because it would mean for them to remove the subscription plans, which would decrease their revenues by a considerable margin. Moreover, to be able to reach our second target group the websites would have to remove their application process for users to become an expert. They will probably not follow this approach because they advertise that only experts answer questions.
