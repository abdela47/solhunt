## Summary -- SolHunt

### Project Objective

Build a platform where students can find answers to specific problems/questions from their textbooks. Users (students) will be able to post their questions on the platform and teachers/tutors/professors will be able to answer them.

### Key personas

- Key persona: John Smith, a university student in Life Sciences, that has a full-time course load and a part-time job. He does not have the time to devote himself to a specific course and needs help solving some problems.

- Key persona: William Brown, a graduate from Ryerson University, that has a lot of knowledge and wants to share it with those in need while also challenge himself with new intriguing problems.
 
### Key scenarios

- John has a very important final coming up and needs to study a lot to pass. He practices with questions from his textbook that the professor recommended, however there are no answers on the textbook for them, and it is too late to seek help from the professor. John is stuck since he does not know if his answers are correct or not.

- William has great general knowledge and wants to help others while challenging himself. He also wants to boost his online reputation.

### Key principles

- Fast and peer reviewed answers: the platform should provide answers in a rapidly manner and reviewed by other users.
- Easy and simple to use: Student should be able to easily find answers to his question on the platform. Responders should also be able to quickly and effectively answer questions.
- Visualize how contributions affect other users: Students are able to easily track their questions and responders their answers.
- Incentives to answer: Platform should provide incentives/rewards for users that answer the most upvoted questions.
- Information is secure: data provided by users should be safely handled.
